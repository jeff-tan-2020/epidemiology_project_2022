Abstract

I designed and implemented two discrete-time epidemiological models to model the transmission of Alpha,
Delta, and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 in North Carolina. These models were inspired by the SIR
and SEIR models but incorporated both vaccination and natural immunity. The model implementation
incorporates cumulative COVID-19 vaccination data as well as reported data on vaccine efficacy. The model
was fitted with cumulative daily COVID-19 case data in North Carolina retrieved from the Centers of Disease
Control and Prevention. The simulation results suggested that despite preventive measures such as masking,
social distancing, and vaccination to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, the estimated effective reproduction
numbers predicted spread for each virus. The SIR model predicted Re values of 1.26 for Alpha, 2.65 for
Delta, and 2.33 for Omicron. The SEIR model predicted slightly higher values of 1.36 for Alpha, 3.35 for
Delta, and 3.34 for Omicron.
